## Concepts

Yield Curve
- When we get an Inverted Yield Curve and short rates are higher than long rates, investors are anticipating low inflation or even deflation.

Stocks
- Buying part of a company
- Hedges against inflation

Bonds
- Loaning money to a company
- Hedges against deflation

Treasury Securities
- Bills — Short-term bonds of 1-5 year terms
- Notes — Mid-term bonds of 6-12 year terms
- Bonds — Long-term bonds of 12+ year terms

Open Market Operations
- Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve sets a target federal funds rate
- Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implements the open market operations to achieve that rate
- Permanent


Marginal Tax Rate - the rate paid on each additional dollar of income

Roth 403(b)
- Post-tax contribution
- Important: you cannot take out contributions without tax or penalty like an Individual Roth IRA
- Qualified widthdrawls after 59.5 years and held the Roth 403b plan for at least five years
- Required to take a RMD but you can rollover to an Individual Roth IRA to avoid this

##  Notes

- Non-deductible Traditional IRA
- Backdoor Roth IRA
  - Only for high-income earners because you can only backdoor the normally allowed
  - Supporting documents: 8606, 5498 (custodian)
